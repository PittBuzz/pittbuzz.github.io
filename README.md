Portfolio

This is my portfolio and it houses some of my projects that I have completed over time.  I have provided a cross reference of work products that I have produced over the years.  These are examples that I beleive are representative of my roles. They can be accessed via the Work Products folder.

There are training and developmental projects as well; they provide a variety of other scenarios and solutions outside of my experience. I have tried to keep the courses grouped together so as not to cause confusion with codes and products. 

I do have other repositories within this site so please feel to peruse them as well.  These are not part of my portfolio and may be redundant as I have migrated several earlier projects to this repository.  I also have forked to other contribtutors and subjects that have interested me over time.

This portfolio will be updated from time to time as I reevaluate what is relevant and additional projects are completed.  I hope that you find some of these interesting and if you would like to contact me you can access my linked in profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackvoltz/

Thanks for stopping by.
