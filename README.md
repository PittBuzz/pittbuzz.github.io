Portfolio

This is my protfolio of some of my project that I have done.  These are mainly MOOCS but the do show a wide variety of different scenarios and solutions.  I have other repositories within my account so please feel to preuse them as well.  They can document my evolutionwith various coding and may be rdundant as I migrate several earlier projects to this repository.
