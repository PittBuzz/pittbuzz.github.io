Portfolio

This is my portfolio and it houses some of my projects that I have completed over time.  These are mainly MOOCS but they do show a wide variety of different scenarios and solutions.  

I do have other repositories within my account so please feel to preuse them as well.  They can document my evolution with various coding and may be redundant as I have migrated several earlier projects to this repository.
